				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					<p>Herro, My name is Erin!! People call me Rin though. 
						<br> I enjoy tech, but dislike coding. I hope to one day become an engineer or therapist. 
						<br>I love soup, soup is delicious and I want to make a new soup recipe in the future and win an award.
						<br> My favorite foods are soup, watermelon, and pizza. Mango Crepe has become a recent obsession and if I had the chance I would have it everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 
						<br>I play many sports but my main sport is badminton and chess (if you count chess as a sport).
